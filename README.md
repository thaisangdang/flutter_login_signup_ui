# Login & Signup UI (Flutter)

A clean, modern authentication flow that mimics real-world applications. This project moves beyond simple buttons to handle complex **User Input**, featuring form validation, error handling, and secure password entry.

<div align="center" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 16px;">

</div>

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By building this project, you will learn:
- **Form Handling:** Using `GlobalKey<FormState>` to validate multiple fields at once.
- **TextFormField:** The difference between a simple TextField and a Form-aware field.
- **Input Validation:** Writing logic to check for valid emails and minimum password lengths.
- **Controllers:** Using `TextEditingController` to read input values (e.g., checking if "Password" matches "Confirm Password").
- **Keyboard Safety:** Wrapping forms in `SingleChildScrollView` to prevent overflow errors when the keyboard pops up.
